## Ideas for model
- GraphVAE : reconstruct a higher dimension $A$ from embeddings (Inner Product Decoder)
- GraphU-NET : only the up part

## References to explore

- DropGNN
- GraphSAGE
- GraphSAINT
- GraphVAE
- GIN

## Improvements
- Data Augmentation
- Add losses, sublosses (new interesting losses )
